# 🧑‍🏫 Biography
My Name is Kangkang Wei (魏康康). I received the Ph.D. degree (Major: Cyberspace Security) in School of Computer Science and Technology from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in June 2024. I am currently a lecture with the School of Software (School of Cyberspace Security), Nanchang University. 

My research interest includes **multimedia content security (e.g., steganalysis and steganography) and multimedia forensics (e.g. AGI and deepfake detection)**. I have published more than 15+ papers at the mainstream journal and international conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>200+</span></strong>.
