# 🧑‍🏫 Biography
My Name is Kangkang Wei. I received the Ph.D. degree in School of Computer Science and Technology from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in June 2024. During my doctoral studies, my major is Cyberspace Security and my supervisor is Professor [Weiqi Luo](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2499). I am currently a lecture with the School of Software (School of Cyberspace Security), Nanchang University. 

My research interest includes **multimedia content security (e.g., steganalysis and steganography) and multimedia forensics (e.g. AI generated image and deepfake detection)**. In addition, I am a member of the CSIG Special Committee on Digital Media Forensics and Security (CSIG-DMFS) and IEEE member. Also as a young editorial board member of Journal of Hainan University (Natural Science). I have published more than 15+ papers at the mainstream journal (e.g., IEEE TIFS et al.) and international conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JMhEzSgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>270+</span></strong>.
